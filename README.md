# p5.palette

This is a **p5.js** library to manage color palettes for fast prototyping and easy development of creative visual applications.

It is strongly inspired on [colorLib](https://github.com/vormplus/colorLib), a [Processing](https://processing.org/) library to work with colors. 

I used to use colorLib in my sketches in Processing, and when I started developing in p5.js I felt a lack of a similar tool, so I developed one with some features that I created based on my needs.

**p5.palette** allows you to create and manipulate color palettes in a very dynamic way, helping in the development of creative coding applications with aesthetics and color harmony, in a very fast pace.
