# p5.palette

A JavaScript library for color palette management in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Introduction

This library helps fast prototyping creative visual applications by providing functions to generate and manage color palettes.

It is strongly inspired by [colorLib](https://github.com/vormplus/colorLib) library for [Processing](https://processing.org/). 

p5.js missed something similar, so while converting some sketches from Processing (Java) to p5.js (JavaScript), I could neatly extract and migrate features from some hacks I had done in colorLib for personal usage, all joined in **p5.palette**.

The library allows you to create and manipulate color palettes in a very dynamic way, helping develop creative coding applications with color harmony, aesthetics, in a very fast pace.
